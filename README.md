##### This repository is collected to review data analyst associate bootcamp from datacamp. There is some favourite code collected in repository. 

##### For those interested in the bootcamp course, you can find more information at the following link: [DataCamp: Associate Data Analyst in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-analyst-in-sql).
## üñäÔ∏èIntroduction
##### Initially, I sought an SQL course to enhance my knowledge to intermediate level. I found this course might suit my needs. It offers a career certification that requires passing a challenging test, as well as interactive projects. 
##### Readers can refer to this repository to gain insight of this bootcamp and certificates. Importantly, to decide whether this course suitable for your need or not. 

## ‚è∞Lessons & Hour required
##### 11 courses + 2 projects, 39 hours

## üí≠Reviews
##### The track is beginner-friendly. The advantage of this is the strong fundamental knowledge you need when you use SQL like Exploratory Data Analysis and data-driven decision-making. However, only some lessons will provide you intermediate knowledge and feel challenging.

##### The 2 projects included are far more uncomplicated compared to the interactive coding in each course. However, it helps you to understand clearly how the query results affect the business as the question is given because of result summarization

##### If you are looking for a more complicated level in this track, I would recommend to try:
##### 1) Data manipulation
##### 2) PostgreSQL summary Stats and Windows function
##### 3) Functions for Manipulation Data in PostgreSQL
##### Additionally, the last two courses, Understanding Data Visualization and Data communication concepts, are conceptual which should find a chance to apply to real situations

##### **After you complete all lessons, you will get track complete batch as below**

## üéìCareer certification
###### Once you complete all lessons, you will be eligible to register for the Data Analyst Associate certificate that requires skills in data management and exploratory analysis with efficiency. 

###### 2 test required for the exam. The maximum hour spent in total is 6 hours. I would say that this is the best part of this pathway

###### The final exam is a bit tricky and deals with your understanding of designing validated data and metric performance. There is more than one way to query the results in some questions. Finally, you will get this certification after you complete the lessons and pass the exam.
