## Lessons



## Reviews
###### The track is beginner-friendly. The advantage of this is the strong fundamental knowledge you need when you use SQL like Exploratory Data Analysis and data-driven decision-making. However, only some lessons will provide you intermediate knowledge and feel challenging.

###### The 2 projects included are far more uncomplicated compared to the interactive coding in each course. However, it helps you to understand clearly how the query results affect the business as the question is given because of result summarization

###### If you are looking for a more complicated level in this track, I would recommend to try:
###### 1) Data manipulation
###### 2) PostgreSQL summary Stats and Windows function
###### 3) Functions for Manipulation Data in PostgreSQL
###### Additionally, the last two courses, Understanding Data Visualization and Data communication concepts, are conceptual which should find a chance to apply to real situations

##### **After you complete all lessons, you will get track complete batch as below**
